This project was my final project at Eastern University for a course on Information Visualization using Tableau.
The Profits Insights Story tab contains all of the storytelling details about the data.

This dashboard was designed to explore and visualize fictional sales data over the United States and identify areas of interest for a fictitious business.

The purpose of this project is to showcase data storytelling and visualizing. 

Project is being remade using Tableau Public for code replication and a more detailed interactive shared version of the dashboard.
